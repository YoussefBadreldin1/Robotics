## Introduction

This repository contains URScript programs for performing various robotic tasks using the Universal Robots Simulator (URSim). These scripts are intended to showcase my skills in robotics and automation, and they can be used as examples or starting points for further development.

## Projects Overview

### Basic Movement Sequence

**File**: `basic_movement_sequence.script`

This script demonstrates a simple movement sequence where the robot moves to a few predefined positions and then returns to the starting position.

### Simulated Pick and Place

**File**: `simulated_pick_and_place.script`

This script simulates a pick-and-place operation without using an end effector. The robot moves to a pick position, simulates picking up an object, moves to a place position, and then returns to the starting position.

### Drawing a Square Path

**File**: `drawing_square_path.script`

This script moves the robot in a square path, simulating a drawing or welding operation. The robot then returns to the starting position.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Universal Robots Simulator (URSim)
- Basic understanding of URScript

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/robotics-projects.git
   cd robotics-projects

### Set up URSim:

1. **Download and install URSim from the Universal Robots website.**
2. **Follow the installation instructions specific to your operating system.**

### Running the Scripts

1. **Open URSim:**
   - Launch the Universal Robots Simulator (URSim) on your machine.

2. **Load a script:**
   - In the URSim interface, go to the **Program** tab.
   - Click on `File` -> `Open` or `Load Program`.
   - Navigate to the directory where you cloned this repository and select the desired `.script` file.

3. **Run the script:**
   - Make sure the Script Code node is selected in the program tree.
   - Click the **Play** button to execute the script.
